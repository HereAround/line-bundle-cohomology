Cohomology for line bundles on toric varieties
==============================================

Code used in [arXiv:1003:5337](http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5337) for the
computation of line bundle cohomology on toric varieties using ÄŒech
cohomology.

For more details and usage instructions see
[here](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/~inaki/cech.html).

Note that more efficient and sofisticated algorithms exist in the
context of toric varieties, for an efficient implementation of these
see for instance
[cohomCalg](http://wwwth.mpp.mpg.de/members/bjurke/cohomcalg/), or the
implementation in [SAGE](http://sagemath.org).
